# Tic_Tac_Toe
This Tic Tac Toe game is a simple implementation using Python and Tkinter, a popular GUI toolkit. Tkinter provides the necessary tools to create a graphical interface for the game, allowing players to interact with the board using clicks. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking their respective symbols (X or O) in empty cells. The game logic checks for win conditions after each move to determine if a player has won or if the game ends in a draw. Tkinter handles the display of the game board and updates it dynamically with each move. Overall, this game provides a fun and interactive way to play the classic Tic Tac Toe game on your computer.
